This project is developed for practice as part of Code Louisville's Front End Web Development course. It does not represent a real business or service in any way, though I suppose it would be nice if this service existed in my area. Users can interact with the offerings menu by hiding sections of the menu, or by clicking a button and getting an alert. I tried to experiment some with color stylings and palettes, but it doesn't come naturally to me. I look forward to studying design more in the future.
